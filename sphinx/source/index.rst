This chapter gives diagrammed examples of basic Lojban sentence structures. The most general pattern is covered first, followed by successive variations on the basic components of the Lojban sentence. There are many more capabilities not covered in this chapter, but covered in detail in later chapters, so this chapter is a 
      quick tour
of the material later covered more slowly throughout the book. It also introduces most of the Lojban words used to discuss Lojban grammar.
    
Let us consider John and Sam and three statements about them:

    
      
.. index::
    single: father ; example


        
.. index::
    single: John and Sam ; example



        
      
###################################################################################################################
      
John is the father of Sam.

    single: sumti ; relation with bridi



.. index::
    single: brivla ; relation to bridi



.. index::
    single: predication ; compared with bridi



.. index::
    single: bridi ; compared with predication



.. index::
    single: predication ; as a relationship



.. index::
    single: relationship ; active/static/attributive compared


These examples all describe relationships between John and Sam. However, in English, we use the noun 

      father
to describe a static relationship in 
      
, the verb 
      hits
to describe an active relationship in 
      In formal logic this whole structure is called a
      predication
; in Lojban it is called a
      bridi
, and the central part of speech is the
      selbri
.

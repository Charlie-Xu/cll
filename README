TO USE DOCKER:

Instead of ./cll_build below, use the same commands with:

  ./run_docker.sh

You don't *need* to use docker, but if you don't you'll have to put
together all the requirements yourself, and they'll need to match
versions, and so on.  I really strongly suggest using the Docker
version.

- ---

To make all the versions do:

  ./cll_build

If you want to also copy it into your personal webspace, do something like:

  ./cll_build -a ~/public_html/cll_build/

This takes quite a while.  To do it for just one chapter for faster
testing:

  ./cll_build -t chapters/05.xml 

This does the whole book but is also much faster:

  ./cll_build -t

There are many possible sub-targets as well, which are specified
with -T, such as:

  ./cll_build -t -T pdf

You can get a complete list of targets via:

  ./cll_build -h

Requirements
------------

Getting this all working is actually a pretty huge undertaking;
you're almost certainly better off asking Robin Lee Powell for an
account on the appropriate server.

  General/HTML
  ------------

    xsltproc

    xmlto

    Normal linux tools probably like tar.  You definitely need wget,
    in particular.

    The actual docbook packages (i.e. the docbook 5.0 XSLT stuff)

    Ruby

    All the Ruby gems mentioned in Gemfile; in fact the normal way to
    do this sort of thing is:

      $ gem install bundler
      $ bundle install

    and that should get all the dependencies for you (although I
    (rlpowell) don't do it that way myself, so this is untested by me
    and you might have to do "bundle exec ..." with your build
    commands or something; regardless, there's only like 3 gem
    dependencies).

  PDF Generation

    prince ( http://www.princexml.com/ )


  MOBI / EPUB
  -----------

    ebook-convert (from calibre, but the yum package doesn't really
    work; use the binary install at
    https://calibre-ebook.com/download_linux )

    Xvfb and xvfb-run (fake X for calibre) or a running X server
    session -- MAYBE NOT ACTUALLY NEEDED

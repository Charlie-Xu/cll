To make the XHTML version (ends up in a dir named html/):

  ./cll_build

This takes quite a while.  To do it for just one chapter for faster
testing:

  ./cll_build -t chapters/05.xml 

This does the whole book but is also much faster:

  ./cll_build -t

There are many possible sub-targets as well, which are specified
with -T, such as:

  ./cll_build -t -T pdf_web

You can get a complete list of targets via:

  ./cll_build -h

Requirements
------------

Getting this all working is actually a pretty huge undertaking;
you're almost certainly better off asking Robin Lee Powell for an
account on the appropriate server.

  General
  --------------

  xsltproc

  xmlto

  PDF Generation
  --------------

  dblatex

  xetex, with a recent version of texlive.  For Fedora, this
  upgrading to F19.  Then install these packages; this may not be a
  complete list, but it should be pretty close:
    
    sudo yum install texlive-xetex texlive-dejavu texlive-multirow texlive-subfigure texlive-appendix texlive-changebar texlive-overpic dejavu-fonts-common dejavu-sans-fonts dejavu-sans-mono-fonts dejavu-serif-fonts texlive-cjkutils-bin texlive-collection-xetex texlive-dvipdfm-bin texlive-jfontmaps-bin texlive-ptex-bin texlive-release texlive-ttfutils-bin texlive-xetex-bin xmltex tex-texlive-common-doc tex-texlive-en-doc tex-texlive-msg-translations tex-texlive-scripts tex-texlive texlive-subfigure texlive-appendix texlive-multirow texlive-multirow texlive-listings texlive-overpic texlive-overpic texlive-changebar texlive-tabulary texlive-savesym texlive-tocloft texlive-framed

  Yes, that's a lot of packages.

  MOBI / EPUB
  -----------

  ebook-convert (from the yum/rpm calibre package)

  Xvfb and xvfb-run (fake X for calibre)
